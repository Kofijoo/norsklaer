# Technology Stack Justification

## Frontend Stack

### React.js v18+
- **Reason**: Component-based architecture for reusable lesson modules
- **Benefit**: Large ecosystem for educational UI components
- **Alternative Considered**: Vue.js (rejected due to smaller edtech community)

### Tailwind CSS
- **Reason**: Utility-first approach for rapid UI development
- **Benefit**: Consistent design system without custom CSS overhead
- **Alternative Considered**: Material-UI (rejected due to bundle size)

## Backend Stack

### Python/Django REST Framework
- **Reason**: Rapid development with built-in admin interface
- **Benefit**: Strong ORM for complex educational data relationships
- **Alternative Considered**: Node.js/Express (rejected due to ML integration complexity)

### PostgreSQL
- **Reason**: ACID compliance for user progress data integrity
- **Benefit**: JSON field support for flexible lesson content storage
- **Alternative Considered**: MongoDB (rejected due to relational data requirements)

## ML/AI Stack

### TensorFlow Lite
- **Reason**: Optimized for edge deployment and mobile compatibility
- **Benefit**: Reduced latency for real-time speech processing
- **Alternative Considered**: PyTorch (rejected due to deployment complexity)

### OpenAI Whisper
- **Reason**: State-of-the-art multilingual speech recognition
- **Benefit**: Norwegian language support with high accuracy
- **Alternative Considered**: Google Speech-to-Text (rejected due to cost)

## Infrastructure Stack

### Docker
- **Reason**: Consistent development and deployment environments
- **Benefit**: Simplified scaling and service isolation
- **Alternative Considered**: Virtual machines (rejected due to resource overhead)

### AWS Free Tier
- **Reason**: Professional cloud infrastructure at zero cost
- **Benefit**: Industry-standard services for portfolio demonstration
- **Alternative Considered**: Heroku (rejected due to limited free tier)

## Development Tools

### GitHub Actions
- **Reason**: Integrated CI/CD with version control
- **Benefit**: Automated testing and deployment pipeline
- **Alternative Considered**: Jenkins (rejected due to setup complexity)

## Budget Constraints Impact
- **Compromise**: Using smaller ML models instead of enterprise-grade solutions
- **Mitigation**: Demonstrating scalability architecture for future enhancement
- **Trade-off**: Limited concurrent users on free tiers, documented for production scaling
